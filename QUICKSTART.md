## Optional: Clean Up Test Data

If you want to remove all rows from the table:

```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This deletes ALL data from the table!

## Troubleshooting

### "HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN not found"
- Make sure you created the `.env` file
- Check that the token is on the right line without extra spaces

### "Failed to connect to HubSpot"
- Verify your token is correct (copy it again)
- Make sure the Private App has HubDB permissions enabled

### "No courses found"
- Check your internet connection
- The Course API might be temporarily unavailable

## Next Steps
