## Setup Options

#### Step 1: Create Gmail App Password

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select **Security** from the left menu
3. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)

5. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)** â†’ Name it "HubSpot Sync"
6. Click **Generate**
7. Copy the 16-character password (you'll need this)

#### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret

Add these secrets:

| Secret Name | Value | Example |

#### Step 3: Done!

That's it! You'll now receive email reports after **every sync** (both successful and failed) with detailed statistics.

## Configuration Options

### Email Reports

By **default**, you'll receive email reports after **every sync** (both successful and failed) with complete statistics including:
- Total courses processed
- Number created
- Number updated  
- Number failed
- Success rate
- Duration

### Multiple Recipients

To send emails to multiple people, use comma-separated addresses in `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`:

```
recipient1@example.com, recipient2@example.com, recipient3@example.com
```

### Disable Email Notifications

Simply don't add the SMTP secrets. The workflow will skip the email step if secrets are missing.

---

## Testing

### Test the Email Setup

1. Go to Actions â†’ Daily Course Sync
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. The workflow will run and send an email (if configured)
4. Check your inbox for the report

### Troubleshooting

**"Failed to send email"**
- Verify all SMTP secrets are correct
- Check that SMTP_PORT is a number (587 or 465)
- For Gmail: Make sure you're using an app password, not your regular password
- For SendGrid: Verify your sender email

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD
- For Gmail: Ensure 2FA is enabled and you created an app password
- For SendGrid: Username must be exactly `apikey`

**"Emails not arriving"**
- Check your spam folder
- Verify NOTIFICATION_EMAIL is correct
- For corporate emails: Check with IT about SMTP restrictions

**"Missing metrics in email"**
- The sync might have failed before generating metrics
- Check the workflow logs for errors
- Metrics are only available if the sync script runs

---

## Security Best Practices

âœ… **Use App Passwords** - Never use your main account password  
âœ… **Use Secrets** - Store credentials in GitHub Secrets, not in code  
âœ… **Limit Permissions** - Use minimal SMTP permissions  
âœ… **Rotate Regularly** - Change app passwords periodically  
âœ… **Monitor Usage** - Check for unauthorized email sends

## GitHub Job Summary

Even without email setup, you'll always see a **beautiful summary** in the GitHub Actions UI:

```
ðŸ“Š Course Sync Summary
âœ… Status: Success

| Metric         | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| Total Courses  | 142    |
| Created        | 8      |
| Updated        | 134    |
| Failed         | 0      |
| Success Rate   | 100.0% |
| Duration       | 45.32s |
```

This appears automatically after each workflow run!
